        In the late August of 2015, I joined cross country. At first I thought I had no chance into getting in the top 10 
        in the meets. In practices I would always get very tired and felt like walking all the time. Yet with my determination, 
        I was able to get 8th place in my first meet. But I still wasn't showing what I could really do. In the last meet of the season 
        I got 3rd place as well as in the leagu finals. I carried on and trained harder than before to prepare for a challenging competition. 
        The county finals. The course had steeps hills that went up and down cuntiously. It was the most tiring course I ever ran. But I never gave up.
        I continued till I reached the finish line and got 10th place overall.
