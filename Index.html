      <p>I joined cross country in the mid August of 2015. I competed against many schools, in which the runners were really fast. Yet, with my speed I was able to get in the top 10. In my last two meets of the season I was able to get into 3rd place as well as in the league finals. I carried on and ran in the county finals where there were many more schools. There I got 10th place. In late April of 2016, I had joined track and field. With my speed, I was able to get into the 4 by 400 meters relay team. In our first meet, we were able to get first for girl in our grade level!</p>
