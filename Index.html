        <p> 
        In the late August of 2015, I joined cross country. At first I thought I had no chance into getting in the top 10 
        in the meets. In practices I would always get very tired and felt like walking all the time. Yet with my determination, 
        I was able to get 8th place in my first meet. But I still wasn't showing what I could really do. In the last meet of the season 
        I got 3rd place as well as in the leagu finals. I carried on and trained harder than before to prepare for a challenging competition. 
        The county finals. The course had steeps hills that went up and down cuntiously. It was the most tiring course I ever ran. But I never gave up.
        I continued till I reached the finish line and got 10th place overall. In the Mid April of 2016, I had joined track and field. There I competed 
        in the 1600 meters run(the mile) and the 4 by 400 meters relay. Since I wanted to try other events out as well, I joined long jump and triple jump. 
        After weeks of training and improving times for mile, 4 by 400 meters relay, and triple jump, I was accepted into league finals. In triple jump I didn't do so good,
        but for mile I got 7th place. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make it to county finals. But there was still one event left. The relay. Surprisingly, that was teh one event that
        I was most worried about. I worried that I wouldn't run fast enough and we would get last place. But it was the complete opposite. When the first runner ran
        she moved us up to 3rd place. She quickly handed the baton the second runner in our team who got us up to 2nd place. The 3rd runner grabbed the baton and did her best
        maintaining 2nd place. At the very end of her lap, her legs started moving faster than ever before. She was catching up to the girl in 1st place. She zoomed pass her handing the baton to me.
        It was now my job as the last runner to maintain first place. I ran as fast as I could, faster than my legs could take me. If I ever felt myself slowing down, I sped up.
        I knew it was not the time to slow down at all. I curved around the track while keeping my pace. It was the last 100 meters and I was worried that the girl behind me was catching up. 
        My reaction was simple. I sped up even more. I crossed the finish line as my teammates cheered me on. We had won first place for league finals and we were going to counties.
