            <p> I joined cross country in the mid August of 2015. I competed against many schools, 
          in which the runners were like gazelles. Yet, with my speed, I was able to get in the top 10. 
          In my last two meets of the season I was finally able to get into 3rd place (including league finals).
          I carried on and ran in the county finals where there were many more schools. There I got 10th place.
